    <p>Reading aloud to children has been shown to improve reading, writing and communication skills, 
    logical thinking and concentration, and general academic aptitude, as well as inspire a lifelong 
    love of reading. Teachers use Storyline Online in their classrooms, and doctors and nurses play 
    Storyline Online in childrenâ€™s hospitals.

        <p>Storyline Online is available 24 hours a day for children, parents, caregivers and educators
        worldwide. Each book includes supplemental curriculum developed by a credentialed elementary 
        educator, aiming to strengthen comprehension and verbal and written skills for English-language learners.
        Storyline Online is a program of the SAG-AFTRA Foundation. The Foundation is a nonprofit organization 
        that relies entirely on gifts, grants and donations to fund Storyline Online and produce all of its videos.
